  aboutme:
    "I come with an Android/Java background meaning that my React Native apps are practically indistinguishable from real native apps. Unlike web developers I know that mobile does not have unlimited resources, I optimize apps until animations and functionalities run smoothly. I worked in the no.1 corporate sector in India for 12 years, as well as worked on self-startup and other startups, and now working at an MNC as a React Native Developer (Sr. Software Engineer). I have developed 40+ native android applications using java while working as a freelancer and developed 10+ hybrid apps using React Native.",
